Act as a senior Python backend engineer. Create a small FastAPI project that I can use to test Zapier webhooks (Option 3 in an automation workflow).

PROJECT GOAL
I want a simple HTTP API that:
- Exposes a POST /events endpoint that Zapier can call via Webhooks.
- Exposes a GET /status endpoint so I can quickly verify the service is up and see some basic stats.
- Logs all incoming webhook payloads and keeps a simple in-memory history so I can see what Zapier is sending.
- Is easy to run locally with uvicorn and expose via ngrok.

TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Use Python 3.11+.
- Use FastAPI.
- Use uvicorn as the ASGI server.
- Include type hints everywhere reasonable.
- Use structured logging (e.g., Python logging with JSON-style messages or clear key/value fields).
- Organize code with a minimal but sane structure:
  - app/main.py (FastAPI app, routes)
  - app/models.py (Pydantic models for requests/responses)
  - app/config.py (basic config: port, environment, etc.)
  - app/storage.py (in-memory event store implementation)
- Include a requirements.txt.

ENDPOINT DETAILS

1) POST /events
- Purpose: receive webhook calls from Zapier.
- Expect JSON body with at least:
  - event_id: str
  - source: str
  - payload: dict | Any
- If event_id is missing, generate a UUID on the server side.
- Validate the incoming data using Pydantic models.
- Store each received event in a simple in-memory store (a list in storage.py is fine for now, with a max size like 100 events and FIFO eviction).
- Log each incoming event with:
  - Timestamp
  - event_id
  - source
  - size of payload (len of JSON string or number of keys)
- Return JSON:
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "event_id": "<resolved_id>",
    "stored_at": "<iso8601 timestamp>"
  }

2) GET /status
- Purpose: quick health and debug endpoint.
- Return:
  - service: "zapier-webhook-receiver"
  - status: "healthy"
  - events_received: total number of events stored in memory
  - last_event: a small summary of the most recent event if any (event_id, source, received_at), or null if none.
- Use a Pydantic response model.

OPTIONAL (NICE TO HAVE)
- GET /events
  - Return a paginated list (simple offset+limit query params) of the stored events.
  - Default limit = 10.
  - Include basic metadata only; it’s fine if payload is included as-is but you can truncate large payloads.

CONFIGURATION
- app/config.py should:
  - Read PORT and ENV from environment variables with sensible defaults (e.g., PORT=8000, ENV="dev").
- In main.py, create the FastAPI app and include the routes in a router.

RUN INSTRUCTIONS
- Provide clear instructions in a README.md:
  - How to create and activate a virtualenv.
  - How to install dependencies from requirements.txt.
  - How to run the app with uvicorn (e.g., `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`).
  - How to test the API using curl or HTTPie.
  - How to use ngrok: example command `ngrok http 8000` and how to plug the public URL into a Zapier Webhook action.

TESTS
- Include a small tests/ directory with:
  - test_events.py using pytest.
  - Tests for:
    - POST /events with valid payload.
    - POST /events without event_id (verify server generates one).
    - GET /status shows updated events_received.

DELIVERABLES
- All source files.
- requirements.txt.
- README.md with setup and usage instructions.
- Tests runnable via `pytest`.

Please generate the full project structure and contents in one go so I can copy it into a new repo or let Cursor apply it directly.
